## Watcher

This site uses the [TVMaze API](http://www.tvmaze.com/api) and Firebase to keep track of watched episodes.

Todo:
* Implement search
* Better styles for the season progress
* Quick action bar
* Show info
* Real auth/login system (should be easy)
  * requires changing the functions for Firebase
  * change the DB rules to private
* Add [React Transition Group](http://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/)
* Some sort of timeline

Up for consideration:
* React Router
* Follow People
* Find common actors
